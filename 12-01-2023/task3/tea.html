    <h1>Explore About tea in differnt places.</h1>
    <p>
      Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over
      cured or fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to
      East Asia which probably originated in the borderlands of southwestern
      China and northern Myanmar.[3][4][5] Tea is also rarely made from the
      leaves of Camellia taliensis.[6][7][8] After plain water, tea is the most
      widely consumed drink in the world.[9] There are many different types of
      tea; some have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour,[10]
      while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty,
      floral, or grassy notes. Tea has a stimulating effect in humans primarily
      due to its caffeine content
